## README

This repository contains the files related to Week 4's Assignment of "Getting and Cleaning Data", a Coursera course by Johns Hopkins University. 
 
The task is about getting and cleaning data that was generated by a wearable tracking device. For more details, see https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project 
 
The following files are included in line with the requirements of the assignment:
* A tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 
* A code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data 
* An R script for performing the analysis 
 
In order to reproduce the tidy data set, the following steps need to be performed: 
1. Download the R script
2. Download the zip file with the original data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
3. Unpack the zip file in the same folder as the R script 
4. Run the R script 

The last step will write the tidy data set in the same folder were the R script is placed.
